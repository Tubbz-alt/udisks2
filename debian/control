Description: D-Bus service to access and manipulate storage devices
 The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices,
 implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,
 unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks
 or USB thumb drives.
 .
 This package also provides the udisksctl utility, which can be used to
 trigger these operations from the command line (if permitted by
 PolicyKit).
 .
 Creating or modifying file systems such as XFS, RAID, or LUKS encryption
 requires that the corresponding mkfs.* and admin tools are installed, such as
 dosfstools for VFAT, xfsprogs for XFS, or cryptsetup for LUKS.
